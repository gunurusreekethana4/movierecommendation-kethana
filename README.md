# Movierecommendation-kethana

Developed a content-based movie recommendation system using a 97M-record dataset, applying data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature scaling before reducing it to 20k records due to memory constraints. Utilized TF-IDF vectorization on movie metadata and computed cosine similarity to determine movie relationships. Optimized performance by storing precomputed similarity matrices with pickle. Built an interactive Streamlit app for real-time recommendations.
